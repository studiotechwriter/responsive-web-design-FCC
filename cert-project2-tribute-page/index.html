        <h3>A Strange Story</h3>
        <p>Way back in 1975, a cat made history. This is the story of a cat named Chester and his human. This human, J. H. Hetherington, had a bit of a problem. He had written a paper and submitted it for peer review. His reviewers noticed that he had written the paper with the first-person plural "we" instead of the first-person singular "I".</p>
        <p>This was a bit of a problem, but nothing insurmountable. However, instead of rewriting the paper in first-person singular, Hetherington decided to find a co-author. Since finding a co-author for a paper that was already complete might have been a bit of a headache, and since the paper was written at home in the company of his cat Chester, Hetherington oddly chose to name his cat as the co-author.</p>
        <p>Hetherington created a pen name for Chester, F.D.C. Willard. The initials are the latin for house cat, <i>felis domesticus</i>, and his name, Chester.</p>
        <h2>F.D.C.</h2>
        <h2>Felis Domesticus Chester</h2>
        <p>Apparently, Chester was bilingual because he published another paper, this time as a sole author, in a French language journal in 1980. That would be Chester's last contribution to physics as he would pass away two years later in 1982.</p>
