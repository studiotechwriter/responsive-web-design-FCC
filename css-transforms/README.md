# Learn CSS Transforms by Building a Penguin
This is a freeCodeCamp.org lesson on CSS transforms in a course called Responsive Web Design. 
You can transform HTML elements to create appealing designs that draw your reader's eye. You can use transforms to rotate elements, scale them, and more.
In this course, you'll build a penguin. You'll use CSS transforms to position and resize the parts of your penguin, create a background, and animate your work.
