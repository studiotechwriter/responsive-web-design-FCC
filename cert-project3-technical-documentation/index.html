          <p>An RFx document is a type of proposal. 
          If you've ever written a grant proposal then you likely have a good understanding of the basic requirements for RFx documents. 
          There are three basic documents:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Request for Information - RFI,</li>
            <li>Request for Qualifications - RFQ, and</li>
            <li>Request for Proposal - RFP</li>
          </ul>
          <p>An RFI is often the least formal document of the three. 
          An RFI is usually requested during the course of the business arrangement. 
          This document can be useful during contract negotiations, but there are often better channels for that. 
          The RFI is a tool used to clarify some matter during the course of production or during construction. 
          The format of an RFI is generally agreed upon during contract negotiations. 
          It often appears as standardized form either submitted in paper or through an online portal.</p>
          <p>An RFQ is used by a Procurement Authority (PA) to judge the fitness of a proponent for the proposed work. 
          The requirements for an RFQ are generally more basic than the RFP, 
          and the PA will likely only ask for a corporate profile, number of available personnel, samples of similar projects, 
          resumes of key personnel, and insurance and bonding guarantees.</p>
          <p>An RFP is similar to an RFQ, and the PA will often ask for the same information, like a profile, resmues and sample projects. 
          The biggest difference here is that an RFP will require a deeper understanding of the proposed work, 
          and the proponent will need to show a detailed plan for approaching the work, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Methodology,</li>
            <li>Project Management Strategies,</li>
            <li>QA / QC,</li>
            <li>Design Review,</li>
            <li>Budgetary Requirements,</li>
            <li>Predicted Personnel Requirements,</li>
            <li>Challenges and Opportunities, and</li>
            <li>a Risk Register</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The above list is neither comprehensive nor will it be fully required for every RFP. 
          Each PA will have their own set of requirements, and it is up to you to determine how best to satisfy those requirements.</p>

          <p>You must have a thorough understanding of English grammar and syntax. 
          A document that is free from errors will impress on the adjudicating committee that your firm will produce satisfactory work during production.
          Beyond that, an RFP will outline what you need to address in your response document. </p>
		  <ul>
            <li>Milestone Schedule:
              <ul>
                <li>A milestone schedule may be outlined in an RFP, and it is best practice to make a statement that affirms your commitment to meeting those milestones.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Project Intent:
              <ul>
                <li>Make sure everyone within your proponent organization understands the intent and scope of the project.</li>
                <li>To eusure a proper evaluation, the PA will have structured their request and tailored it to suit the project.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
			<code><strong>Note: </strong>Fulfill all requirements in the order requested.</code>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Format Requrements:
              <ul>
                <li>The PA may have strict requirements for a maximum number of pages, the size of paper, fold out and chart sizes, etc.</li>
                <li>Pay attention to the <i>inclusions</i> and <i>exclusions</i>.</li>
                <li>The PA may include resumes and unsolicited supplementary information, but exclude transmittal letters, covers, cover letters, table of contents, or attached forms.</li>
                <li>There will likely be strict requirements for how the document must be submitted down to the binding (coil bound or permanent soft-cover binding), 
                how many extra copies beyond the one marked "Original", and the file size of the electronic document/PDF.</li>
                <li>You may find a very specific requirement for font size and margins, like this:</li>
              </ul>
			</li>
			  <code>Use minimum 10 point Helvetica, 12 point Times New Roman, or equivalent font size. Provide minimum 20mm (3/4”) margins on all four sides.</code>
		  </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Mandatory Requirements:
              <ul>
                <li>Mandatory requirements often come in the form of surety prequalificaiton letters, confirmation of boding capacity, 
                confirmation of good standing, or proof of licence to practice within the jurisdiction of the proposed work.</li>
                <li>Failure to meet any of the mandatory requirements often results in disqualification.</li>
                <li>Mandatory requirements also include the submission deadline. Give yourself time on the day of to get the submission to the PA, 
                especially if the proposal must be sent as a hard copy via courier.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
              <code>Submissions will be received up to 2:00 p.m., on October 14, 2024</code>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Corporate Profile:
              <ul>
                <li>The PA will need to know who you are. Provide general information about the proponent.</li>
                <li>This profile can include a history of the firm, years in business, office locations, number of staff, types of services provided, specialist areas of expertise, etc.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Proposed Team and Minimum Qualifications:
              <ul>
                <li>The PA will require certain personnel with minimum qualifications which may include a project manager, supervisor, quality manager, HR manager, 
                Health and Safety, union representative, etc.</li>
                <li>It is not necessary to name your entire work crew, including forepersons, sub-forpersons, lead hands, etc., unless that is specifically requested in the RFP.</li>
                <li>You may need to provide proof of qualifications in the form of certifications or memberships to professional organizations.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Experience and Past Performance Record:
              <ul>
                <li>Relevant experience may be outlined in corporate resumes.</li>
                <li>Outline your project experience either in an eye-catching corporate brochure format, or use a standardized format for project information like CCDC 11.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Project Comprehension:
              <ul>
                <li>Outline the challenges and opportunities present in the Work. Specifically identify challenges not outlined in the RFP and suggest approaches for addressing them.</li>
                <li>Describe any special considerations.</li>
                <li>Detail Value-Add items.</li>
                <li>List predicted workforce requirements.</li>

                <li>Describe priorities and sequences.</li>
                <li>Describe coordination of the Work and how to optimize reporting.</li>
                <li>Be specific in your descriptions of your approach to the Work.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <code><strong>Hint:</strong> The PA will often include the same proposal evaluation form that they will be using to evaluate each submission. 
          It is best practice to plan your document sections to follow the same order as the evaluation form.</code>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Envelope_of_Discourse">
        <header>Envelope of Discourse</header>
        <div>
          <p>I will be brief. The people who will be evaluating your proposal work in the same industry as you, and they generally operate within the same envelope of discourse as you. 
          It is not necessary to provide definitions for basic principles of project management, for example. 
          You may have a strict page limit, and it will not benefit you to take up space defining aspects of Lean Manufacturing. 
          The evaluator will appreciate brevity and concise statements.</p>
          <p>The spaces where you will need to provide extra information will be the parts of the proposal that are outside the envelope of discourse. 
          Aspects that are specific to your trade or specialization are the best chances to show that you know what you're talking about and that you have the expertise to deliver quality outcomes. 
          Remember, it is your job to create a compelling narrative that shows your firm is the best fit for the project.</p>
          <code><strong>Hint:</strong> Comb through the RFP to find keywords that you can use in your response submission. 
			  Repeated words and phrases are good indicators of the existing envelope of discourse.</code>
          <code><strong>Caution:</strong> Do not copy the words and phrases directly. 
          The proposal evaluators often include the author of the RFP. 
          You should mirror the language of the RFP, not plagiarize it.</code>

        <header>Document Design</header>
        <div>
		<p>A good cover will do wonders for your proposal.</p>
        <code><strong>Hint:</strong> Hire a designer.</code>
		<p>Here is a basic list of design elements you can incorporate into your response document:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a clean professional layout,
              <ul>
                <li>you may want to mirror the layout of the RFP to some extent;</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>a cover letter (transmittal letter) on your firm's letterhead;</li>
            <li>a hyperlinked table of contents;</li>
            <li>a bookmarked PDF;</li>
            <li>clear demarcation of proposal sections,
              <ul>
                <li>start each section on a new page;</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>be consistent,
              <ul>
                <li>use <strong>styles</strong> to format your headings, subheadings and body;</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>create a color palette based on your corporate identity and apply it consistently; and</li>
            <li>follow the RFP guidelines for font, margins, page length, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Beyond this list there are other best practices for good document design. Be clear, concise, and above all, consistent.</p>

        <header>Proofread and Copyedit</header>
		<div>
        <p>Your document should be proofread before submission.</p>
        <code><strong>Hint:</strong> Hire a copy editor.</code>
        <ul>
		  <li>In the absence of a professional copy editor, your final document should at the very least be proofread by someone other than the author.</li>
          <li>If your response was created by committee, have the final document proofread by someone not on the committee.</li>
		</ul>
        </div>
        <div>
        <p>Here is a proofreading checklist:</p>
          <h2>Proofreading Checklist</h2>
          <p><strong>Test Print:</strong> Print a copy of your PDF to see if all marks will print.</p>
          <code><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using stamps or other markups, they will not print by default. 
			  You must export that page from your document, flatten it, then reinsert the page into your document. 
			  Do this step before your proofreading checklist. 
			  If you flatten the entire document, you will lose your hyperlinks.</code>
          <h3>Proofreading Steps:</h3>
